Some of the features and technologies of the event management project are:

- User can search and book events based on different categories, such as silver, platinum, or gold.
- User can see customer reviews, management specialties, services, and event gallery on the website.
- I used Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, which are popular and powerful tools for web development.
- I used Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for the frontend, which are modern and responsive frameworks for styling your website.
- I used Firebase for authentication, which is a secure and scalable platform for managing user accounts and data.
